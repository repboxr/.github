# Repbox

The `repboxr` organisation contains packages for the *Repbox* project that shall facilitate reproducible research. (*Unfornately `repbox` was already taken as an organisation name on Github. Since most of the code is in R, I picked `repboxr`.) The development is concentrated on economics and social sciences.

Currently, all packages are in a pilot phase and the project needs substantial large scale testing, improvement and documentation. It still a long way to go. While currently almost all contributions are by Sebastian Kranz (Ulm University), the goals is that a stable version will have a wide community including ata editors, authors and researchers performing meta studies.
